💧 Drink Water Tracker
This is a simple, interactive hydration tracker built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It visually helps users monitor their daily water intake toward a 2-liter goal using clickable cups.

🚀 Features
Visually track water intake in 250ml increments.
Clickable cups that toggle between empty and full.
Animated updates for the main water container.
Clearly displays the remaining liters and filled percentage.


📜 How It Works
Each small cup represents 250ml of water.
Clicking a cup fills all cups up to that one.
The main large cup shows:
The percentage filled.
The remaining liters to reach the 2-liter goal.
Fully filling all cups hides the remaining section, indicating the goal is complete.
